ASP.NET website template derived from my existing website - derilov.com

# Features
The template has set up sass support which is configured to replace site.css each time a new copy of the sass files is saved (located in /Styles/).
The theme system is a pretty neat way to keep your colors organized, all the color gradients are stored in a map with values 
1 and 2 representing the two colors (located in /Styles/_variables.scss).

# About
I know Microsoft isn't the most avid supporter of open source but I think they have taken a few notes from the free software
movement. It seems kinda weird making a free website with their framework but hey it isn't half bad. There's a lot of room
for improvement so feel free to improve it for your own use and share it.
